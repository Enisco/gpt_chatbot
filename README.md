# gpt_chatbot

A Flutter demo ChatBot app using ChatGPT.

Using ChatGPT in Flutter is relatively easy and straightforward. 
It has to be noted that the ChatGPT API token to be used has to be one from a ChatGPT account that has an active subscription, if not it will not work.

To get your ChatGPT Api token, follow the following steps:

  - Go to https://openai.com/, then at the top-right corner, click on "Log In" if you already have an account, or "Sign Up" if you don't.

   - After logging in, you should be on the page below. Select "API".

   - Then on the page below, click on your account at the top-right corner.

   - Then click on "View API Keys"

   - Select "Create New Secret Key"

   - Name the key. This is optional but it's good to name keys in case you are going to have multiple keys

   - Click on "Create New Key", and you will see your new Key as shown below.
   - YOU MUST COPY THE KEY AND SAVE IT SOMEWHERE, BECAUSE THIS IS THE ONLY TIME YOU CAN SEE IT.
